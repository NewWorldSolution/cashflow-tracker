# P1-I8 — Hierarchical Categories + Manual VAT + Procedure Metadata
## Task Board

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Last updated:** 2026-03-24
**Iteration branch:** `feature/phase-1/iteration-8` ← all task PRs target this branch
**Final PR:** `feature/phase-1/iteration-8` → `main` ← QA agent approves before merge

## Goal

Replace the flat 22-category testing structure with a real two-level business taxonomy (19 parent groups, 62 subcategories), rename direction from income/expense to cash_in/cash_out, add manual VAT mode for mixed-rate invoices, and introduce procedure metadata (customer_type, document_flow, for_accountant default change).

After I8:
- direction uses `cash_in` / `cash_out` throughout
- `income_type` renamed to `cash_in_type`
- create/correct forms use a two-level category picker
- transactions can use either automatic or manual VAT mode
- every transaction has `customer_type` (private/company/other)
- external cash_in requires `document_flow`; cash_out has it optional
- `for_accountant` defaults to true (except internal cash_in)
- list/detail/dashboard show category paths, manual VAT indicator, and metadata

## Dependency Map

```text
T1 (direction rename + schema foundations)
  └── T2 (category seed + hierarchy + i18n)
        └── T3 (validation + services)
              └── T4 (category picker UI)
                    └── T5 (VAT mode UI)
                          └── T6 (procedure metadata UI)
                                └── T7 (list/detail/dashboard display)
                                      └── T8 (tests)
```

All tasks are sequential. Each depends on the previous.

## Important Notes

- **Fresh start on categories** — old 22 test categories are dropped entirely, no migration needed
- **Direction rename is foundational** — must happen in T1 before anything else
- **`income_type` → `cash_in_type`** — column rename, values stay `internal`/`external`
- **`vat_rate` becomes nullable** — NULL when `vat_mode = manual`
- **No VAT inheritance** — leaf rows are the source of truth for VAT defaults
- **Only leaf categories are selectable** — parent rows are for grouping/reporting only
- **`customer_type` is required on ALL transactions** — `private`/`company`/`other`
- **Internal cash_in forces:** VAT 0, cash, for_accountant=false, customer_type=private (hidden), document_flow hidden, vat_mode=automatic
- **`document_flow`:** required for external cash_in (default `receipt`), optional for cash_out, hidden for internal
- **`invoice_and_receipt` only when `customer_type = private`** — cross-field validation
- **`for_accountant` defaults to true** — except internal cash_in which forces false
- **Correction preserves stored values** — does not re-apply defaults
- **All new labels must have EN + PL translations**
- **Default locale is `pl`** — Polish is the default, English is fallback
